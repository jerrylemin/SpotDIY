# Session handoff

The authoritative handoff is the repository-root [session_handoff.md](../../session_handoff.md).

Plans 01–03 provide the Tauri/React shell, typed unified domain, SQLite/WAL
storage through schema version 2, durable settings, persistent local library,
metadata/artwork/fingerprints, watcher recovery, typed library IPC, and safe
reveal. Plan 04 provides the external mpv playback service and transient queue.

The Plan 04 feature commit is `536617d`; review fixes are in `af66127`. Its
release and smoke evidence pass: 117 all-target Rust tests, 26 frontend tests,
three-width Playwright (9 runs), synthetic real-mpv transport, and packaged
playback/restart/process cleanup. The single fresh independent review passed
with no critical, high, or correctness/security medium findings.

The next plan is Plan 05 — Source Adapters and Search. Do not begin Source
Fusion, provider playback, or persistent queue work in that plan without its
own approved boundary.
